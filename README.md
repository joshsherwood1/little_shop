# Little Shop
Turing Back-End Development Program, Mod 2, Week 2/3 Pair Project.

By: Joshua Sherwood and Nancy Lee


## Background and Description
In this project, we've added additional functionalities to an existing repo (i.e., a fictitious e-commerce platform called [little_shop](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/little_shop_1906) built with Rails) that mimic online transactions in a more realistic way.


## Required functionalities
The project is guided by the user stories (as shown below), given in the order of increasing complexity. The project demonstrates the following concepts taught in Mod 2:

- HTTP requests and responses facilitated by RESTful and non-RESTful routes
- separation of logic via MVC framework
- one-to-many & many-to-many relationships between two tables
- creation of a join table
- creation of case-specific flash messages
- making database queries via ORM (i.e., ActiveRecord) and params
- session that holds temporary user information
- refactoring of the presentational logic through partials

Below is a snapshot of the project database via active designer (showing different types of relationships)

## Additional functionalities
A few notable functionalities that we also implemented during this project include:

- Handling invalid HTTP requests ('this page does not exist')
- Updating cart contents based on client behavior (i.e., order submission renders an empty cart)
- Applying bootstrap styling, including layouts, navigation bar, cards, buttons, and star glyphicons
